# Ars Anima

Evolution gives rise to complex behaviours and outcomes, the motivations for which may be difficult to reason about based on the result alone. This difficulty can be attributed in part to the immense timescales required for evolutionary changes to occur. The aim of this research is to expose this enigmatic process visually, and show that incremental change can give rise to complex outcomes.  

Ars Anima is a generative artificial life simulation, visualising the process of evolution. In the work, abstract virtual creatures live and die in an accelerated genetic struggle to be the fittest survivors. Through interacting with the work, curious audience members can explore unexpected behaviours that emerge as the creatures adapt to a changing virtual environment. The work employs practices of representation though visualisation, interaction design, and artificial intelligence, specifically the field of Evolutionary Art (EvoArt).
